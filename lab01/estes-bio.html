            Hi! Iâ€™m Eliza Estes. 

            I am an applied data analytics major with interests in examining entertainment and media data. Some skills I have acquired are data visualization, an understanding of Python, statistical analysis, problem solving, critical thinking and an understanding of data ethics. Outside of work, I enjoy being outside, spending time with friends, and trying all different kinds of food. I also love watching a good tv show or movie, some of my favorites being New Girl, Community, and Pitch Perfect.
