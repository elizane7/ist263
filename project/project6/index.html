<h1>College Cooking Made Easy!</h1>
<main>
<p>
    Being a college student comes with a lot of responsibilities. On top of keeping up your grades, participating in extracurriculars, and all the other facets of student life, you are supposed to feed yourself three balanced meals a day. It seems like a simple task, but as the work piles up, it can get pretty difficult, especially when you are shopping on a budget.  

    To help ease the stress, I have compiled some easy, low cost recipes that are perfect for college students!
